Vacancy and Employment Management System

Overview

The Vacancy and Employment Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the recruitment process for Human Resources (HR) teams. The system is built to 
facilitate the creation, management, and tracking of job postings, candidate applications, and employee data. The solution serves as a central hub for HR departments to manage 
the entire recruitment cycle, from posting job vacancies to tracking applicants, conducting interviews, and finalizing employment decisions.

This project is aimed at simplifying the recruitment workflow for both HR professionals and job seekers, ensuring a seamless and efficient process for hiring and employment management.

Key Features

Job Posting Management
HR managers can create, update, and manage job listings, including job descriptions, required qualifications, departments, and locations. This feature allows HR teams to keep track of 
open positions across different departments in real-time.

Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

The platform includes a fully functional Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that allows HR teams to receive and review applications. HR can easily access candidate resumes, cover letters,
and track the status of each applicant as they move through the recruitment pipeline (e.g., applied, interviewed, accepted, or rejected).

Employee Data Management

The system offers centralized management of employee information, including personal details, job roles, department assignments, and employment status. This feature ensures HR has 
quick access to accurate, up-to-date employee records.

Role-Based Access Control

The platform provides secure access control by implementing role-based permissions. Different user roles (e.g., HR, Team Leader, Manager) are given access to specific functionalities 
based on their responsibilities within the system.
